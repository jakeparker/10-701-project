# 10-701 Project

## Project Proposal Rubric
*  [NIPS format](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) (one page excluding references, no abstract needed)  
*  A well-stated problem that you plan to explore  
*  The motivation behind this problem  
*  Relevant prior work (or similar work), if any  
*  Your proposed idea/method/approach  
*  How do you plan to implement your approach (e.g. for deep learning, tensorflow/pytorch/...?)  
*  A timeline of this project (just give an estimate), and what dataset you plan to use
